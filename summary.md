When using AI to offer personalised treatment, the function and importance of medical records and data cannot be overstated. A patient's whole medical history, including diagnoses, treatments, prescriptions, and test results, are all included in their electronic medical records (EMR). These records offer a plethora of information that may be used by algorithms powered by artificial intelligence to spot patterns, trends, and unique traits in patients. Healthcare professionals may use AI technology to forecast the onset of particular diseases and provide personalised therapies based on the particular characteristics of each patient. This method provides more focused and precise medical interventions, increasing patient outcomes and making the most use of available resources for healthcare. The foundation for AI-based novel medication development is provided by medical records, allowing researchers to analyse extensive EMR data to find possible drug candidates and improve treatment strategies. To retain data quality and patient privacy while utilising the promise of AI to offer personalised treatment, it is crucial to secure the standardisation, improvement, and preservation of EMR data.
