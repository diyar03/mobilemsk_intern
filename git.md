Git GitHub
Git is a version control system that tracks changes in your files over time,
 allowing you to easily manage and collaborate on projects. It is divided into 
three parts: Working Directory, Staging Area and Commit. It helps you keep track 
of who made what changes and allows you to revert to previous versions if needed.
 GitHub also known as remote repository, on the other hand, is a platform that hosts
 Git repositories in the cloud. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing and 
sharing your Git projects. You can create repositories, collaborate with others, and 
contribute to open-source projects.
