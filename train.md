Python Training Project Course

The extensive six-hour seminar was expertly planned and gave me fresh information. 
It addressed a wide range of subjects, including Python machine learning and object-oriented programming. Near the conclusion, we started a training project in which we built our own website using Python and Django. The procedure required using pip to install Django and putting most of the fundamentals that had been covered throughout the session into practise. This led to a happy course conclusion as we were able to build a beautiful website for selling fruits in our PyShop using the knowledge and abilities we had acquired.
